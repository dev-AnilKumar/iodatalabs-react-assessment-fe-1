# 🚀 React Developer Assessment - Getting Started

## Welcome!

Thank you for your interest in our React Developer position. This take-home assessment is designed to evaluate your React skills through implementing real-time search functionality in a Report Management System.

## 🎯 What You'll Be Building
You'll enhance an existing React application with:
- Real-time search with debouncing
- CSV export functionality for filtered data
- Proper loading states and error handling
- Integration with existing filters

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React 19** with modern hooks
- **TanStack Table** for data tables
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Vite** for development

## 📋 Instructions

1. **Setup:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Review the current application** at http://localhost:5173

3. **Read the detailed tasks** in `ASSESSMENT_TASKS.md`

4. **Complete both tasks** within the time limit

## 📝 What We're Looking For
- Clean React hook implementation
- Proper debouncing technique
- CSV export functionality with file handling
- Good user experience decisions
- Understanding of React patterns and performance

## 🆘 Need Help?
- Check existing code for patterns
- Console.log is your friend for debugging
- Make reasonable assumptions if requirements are unclear
- Focus on functionality first, polish later

## 📤 Submission
- Ensure your code runs without errors
- Include brief comments explaining your debouncing approach and CSV export logic
- No need to deploy - local development is fine

**Good luck! We're excited to see your React skills in action! 🎉**
